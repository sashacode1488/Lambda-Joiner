### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Dual Payload Support**: Combine up to two files into a single executable.
* **üîí XOR Encryption**: Payloads are encrypted with a random XOR key to reduce static detection.
* **üé≠ Masquerading**: Change the final executable's icon to disguise it as another application.
* **üïµÔ∏è Evasion & Obfuscation**:
    * **Anti-Debugging**: Includes a check to see if a debugger is present.
    * **File Pumping**: Increase the file size to evade some sandbox size restrictions.
    * **UPX Packing**: Optionally pack the final executable with UPX for further obfuscation.
* **üöÄ Advanced Execution**:
    * **Process Injection**: Inject the first payload directly into a running process (e.g., `explorer.exe`).
    * **UAC Bypass**: A technique to attempt running a payload with higher privileges without a UAC prompt.
    * **Hidden Launch**: Run payloads silently in the background.
* **üé¨ Launch Behavior**:
    * **Custom MessageBox**: Display a fake error or information message upon launch.
    * **Self-Destruct**: The final executable can delete itself after running the payloads.
    * **File Hiding**: Automatically apply the "Hidden" attribute to the file after launch.
* **üåê Multi-Language GUI**: Modern user interface available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian.
